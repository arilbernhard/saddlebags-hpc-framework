 BAFTA Award for Best British Film  The BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film is given annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts presented at the British Academy Film Awards. The award was first given at the 1st British Academy Film Awards, recognising the films of 1947, and lasted until 1968. For over two decades there was not a specific category for British cinema, until it was revived at the 46th British Academy Film Awards, recognising the films of 1992. It was previously known as the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film; while still given in honour of Korda, the award is now called "Outstanding British Film".  In the following lists, the titles and names in bold with a dark grey background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year
