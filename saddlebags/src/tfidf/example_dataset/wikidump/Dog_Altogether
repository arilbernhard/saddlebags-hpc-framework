 Dog Altogether  Dog Altogether is the first short film to be entirely written and directed by Paddy Considine. The term 'Dog Altogether' comes from an Irish expression that Paddy's father used to use when situations got really bad. It was filmed on 22 January 2007 in Glasgow.  The lead role of Joseph is taken by Scottish actor/director Peter Mullan who was hand picked by Paddy to play a role loosely based on Paddy's late father (also called Joseph). Mullan is a winner of several BIFA and BAFTA best actor awards. British comedy actress Olivia Colman fills the supporting role as Anita. Colman, already having shot British comedy film "Hot Fuzz" with Paddy was approached to play the part due to her suitability for the role.  The story of this short was later expanded into the first Considine's feature film "Tyrannosaur" with the same actors as the main characters.  "Dog Altogether" is the story of Joseph (Peter Mullan), a man who is plagued by a violence and rage that is driving him to self-destruction. As he falls further into turmoil Joseph scours the landscape in search of a single grain of redemption that might restore hope to his fractured life
