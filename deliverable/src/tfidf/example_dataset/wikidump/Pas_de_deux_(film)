 Pas de deux (film)  Pas de deux (released as Duo in the United States) is a 1968 short dance film by Norman McLaren, produced by the National Film Board of Canada.  The film was photographed on high contrast stock, with optical, step-and-repeat printing, for a sensuous and almost stroboscopic appearance. It shows a ballerina (Margaret Mercier) dancing by herself (or rather, with images of herself), before being joined by a male dancer (Vincent Warren), to perform the "pas de deux" of the title, as choreographed by Ludmilla Chiriaeff.  The film is choreographed to Romanian pan pipe music.  "Pas de deux" received 17 awards, including the 1969 BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film and an Academy Award nomination, as "Duo"
