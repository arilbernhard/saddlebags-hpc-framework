 Robert Huber  Robert Huber (born 20 February 1937) is a German biochemist and Nobel laureate.  He was born 20 February 1937 in Munich where his father, Sebastian, was a bank cashier. He was educated at the Humanistisches Karls-Gymnasium from 1947 to 1956 and then studied chemistry at the Technische Hochschule, receiving his diploma in 1960. He stayed, and did research into using crystallography to elucidate the structure of organic compounds.  In 1971 he became a director at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry where his team developed methods for the crystallography of proteins.  In 1988 he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry jointly with Johann Deisenhofer and Hartmut Michel. The trio were recognized for their work in first crystallizing an intramembrane protein important in photosynthesis in purple bacteria, and subsequently applying X-ray crystallography to elucidate the protein's structure. The information provided the first insight into the structural bodies that performed the integral function of photosynthesis. This insight could be translated to understand the more complex analogue of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria which is essentially the same as that in chloroplasts of higher plants.  In 2006, he took up a post at the Cardiff University to spearhead the development of Structural Biology at the university on a part-time basis.  Since 2005 he has been doing research at the "Center for medical biotechnology" of the University of Duisburg-Essen.  Huber was one of the original editors of the Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry  In 1977 Huber was awarded the Otto Warburg Medal. In 1988 he was awarded the Nobel Prize and in 1992 the Sir Hans Krebs Medal. Huber was elected a member of Pour le MÃ©rite for Sciences and Arts, in 1993 and Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1999. His certificate of election reads:   Huber is married with four childr
