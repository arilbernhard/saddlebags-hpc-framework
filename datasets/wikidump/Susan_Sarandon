On March 28, 2016, in an interview on "All In with Chris Hayes", Sarandon indicated that she and other Sanders supporters might not support Hillary Clinton if Clinton is the Democratic nominee for President. She stated: "You know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately. If he gets in, then things will really explode." Hayes inquired as to whether it would be dangerous to allow Trump to become president, to which she replied: "If you think that it's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch with the status quo".

In an interview with "The Guardian" published on November 26, 2017, Sarandon said about Hillary Clinton: "I did think she was very, very dangerous.
